NeverScripts üéÆ

Enhance Your Counter-Strike 2 Experience
NeverScripts is a lightweight, open-source tool crafted for Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) fans to personalize and streamline their gameplay. It operates externally‚Äînever modifying game memory or files‚Äîusing only what CS2 provides through console commands, Game State Integration (GSI), and log files.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
NeverScripts is a personal project by an independent developer, not affiliated with or endorsed by Valve Corporation, the creators of CS2. It offers features like Auto Accept, Jump Throw, and Bomb Timer to enhance convenience and fun. However:

Valve‚Äôs Rules: Some features automate actions via external inputs or scripts. Valve discourages automation in competitive play, and while ErScripts avoids game memory manipulation (no VAC violations), use in official matchmaking may still risk account bans at Valve‚Äôs discretion.
User Responsibility: You are solely responsible for complying with Valve‚Äôs Terms of Service and CS2 Rules. The developer is not liable for bans, data issues, or loss of functionality.
Intended Use: This tool is for personal enjoyment, experimentation, and learning‚Äînot for gaining unfair advantages. Use it responsibly in appropriate settings (e.g., private servers or casual play) to respect the CS2 community.
‚ú® What is NeverScripts?
NeverScripts is a utility that adds convenience and flair to CS2 through an external overlay and automation features. It leverages:

External Overlay: Tracks CS2‚Äôs window for visual enhancements.
Config & Binds: Executes commands via CS2‚Äôs built-in exec system (e.g., bind "KEY" "exec erscripts").
Game State Integration (GSI): Reads live game data like weapon status or bomb timers.
Console Logs: Parses console.log for events like match acceptance.
No game files are altered beyond user-created configs, and no hacks are involved‚Äîjust clean, creative tools for CS2 enthusiasts.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Get started easily:

Download: Grab the latest release from GitHub Releases.
Set Launch Options: In Steam, add -conclearlog -condebug +bind scancode104 exec erscripts1 to CS2‚Äôs launch options.
First Run: Launch NeverScripts.exe before CS2 (afterward, it‚Äôs fine to start with CS2 running).
Play: Open CS2, config settings in the ErScripts menu (press Insert to show/hide the menu), and enjoy!
Exit: Close via the "X" button in the menu or press the "End" key.
Fullscreen Mode: To play in fullscreen mode, right-click cs2.exe, go to Properties ‚Üí Compatibility, and uncheck the Disable fullscreen optimizations.
You can change the key bindings for opening the menu and exiting the program in Menu ‚Üí Custom Binds.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Tailor NeverScripts to your liking:

Auto Accept
Waiting Time: Delay (in seconds) before searching for the "Accept" button.
Bomb Timer
Scale: Adjust timer size.
Gradient: Enable/disable gradient icon.
Transparency: Set background opacity.
Sniper Crosshair
Reload Icon: Syncs with your in-game crosshair settings.
Keystrokes
Scale: Size of the display.
Gradient: Toggle gradient text.
Animation Speed: Speed of keypress animations.
Colors: Customize pressed/released colors.
Transparency: Opacity when keys are released.
Kill Sound, Round Start Alert
Volume: Adjust sound loudness.
File Name: Specify the WAV file for the custom sound.
Leave empty to use the default sound.
Enter a custom WAV file (e.g., sound.wav) located in the executable‚Äôs folder.
You can write without specifying .wav (e.g., if it‚Äôs sound.wav, just write sound).
You can use a subfolder like sounds (e.g., sounds/audio.wav or sounds/audio).
If the file is missing or invalid, it defaults to the built-in sound.
Auto Stop
Toggle: Enables hotkey to toggle auto-stop on/off (true) or activates it only while held (false).
Watermark
Gradient: Toggle gradient text.
Transparency: Background opacity.
Ping Update Rate: Refresh frequency for ping display.
Gradient Manager (RGB Effects)
Steps: Smoothness of color transitions.
Delay: Speed of color shifts.
Start/End Hue: Choose color range.
Saturation: Color intensity (0 = gray, 1 = vibrant).
Value: Brightness (0 = dark, 1 = bright).
Other features (e.g., Knife Switch, Jump Throw, FPS Limiter) are easy to configure‚Äîno details needed here!

üß† How It Works
NeverScripts enhances CS2 safely and externally by:

Command Sending: Features like Jump Throw, Drop Bomb, and Auto Pistol work by writing CS2 commands (e.g., +jump; -attack) to numbered config files (e.g., erscripts1.cfg). These are triggered via pre-bound keys (e.g., F13 to F24) simulated by ErScripts. In CS2, you bind a key to exec erscripts1 (set via launch options), and ErScripts presses that key to run the command.
Auto Accept: Monitors console.log for match detection, then simulates a mouse click on the "Accept" button.
Sniper Crosshair: Reads active weapon data from GSI and overlays a custom crosshair synced with your settings.
Bomb Timer: Tracks bomb state via GSI, updating the display with defuse urgency cues.
RGB Crosshair: Cycles colors by sending console commands to adjust crosshair settings.
Knife Switch: Uses switchhands via config files triggered by keybinds.
This method relies entirely on CS2‚Äôs native systems‚Äîno memory reading, writing, or injection‚Äîkeeping it aligned with standard scripting practices while avoiding game file tampering.
